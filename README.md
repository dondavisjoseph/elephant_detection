#Purpose of Elephant Detection:

The purpose of developing an elephant detection model could be to assist farmers and inhabitants living near forest areas. Elephants can sometimes pose threats to crops, property, and human safety. With an accurate detection model, farmers and residents can be alerted to the presence of elephants, enabling them to take preventive measures to protect their crops and property. This can contribute to reducing human-elephant conflicts and promoting coexistence between wildlife and communities.
